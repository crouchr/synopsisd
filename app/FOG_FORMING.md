(Radiation?) fog occurs when moist air cools to the point where the water starts to condense.
Warm air can "hold" more water vapor than cold air.
As humid air cools down, it gets to the saturation point, and water vapor turns into liquid water.
Since the vapor is dispersed throughout the air, it condenses into millions of tiny water droplets, which we call "fog".

So, any kind of condensation generally requires a temperature change. At night, the air cools, and water begins to condense.
Grass cools faster than the ground beneath it (because it has more surface area), and tends to collect the settling water drops.

You ask about fog in the day. Fog usually forms at night, as the temperature drops, and it usually evaporates when the sun comes up and things warm.
If it does form in the day, it's usually because a front of cold air moves in and mixes with the warm, moist air. That cools down the water vapor in the air enough to make it condense. That's possible, but rare when the sun is out. Fog requires cold, and that usually happens at night.


fog relies on 
- temperature < X
- temperature = wet bulb temp = dew point temp
- wind < X
- solar radiation < X ? - i.e. will start burning off fog
- Rainy day (water) with temperature drop

Qs:
- What happens to humidity before/after rain ?
